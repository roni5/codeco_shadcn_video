# Legacy / Expanded Standards (Archived)

This file holds references to older or expanded standards (per-language deep dives, alternate tooling choices, duplicated workflows). They are archived to keep day‑to‑day prompts and reviews small and cheap.

Use the Lean Rules instead: `playbooks/lean-standards.md`.

If a project needs language‑specific or infra‑specific extensions (Python/Java/Terraform/AWS Bedrock/etc.), add a short section here and link to an external doc. Do not paste large guidance into PRs or chat; link it.
