 Google has significantly increased the security and verification requirements over the past few years, which makes the setup a "nightmare" compared to how it might have been in early 2025.
 Verify the File PathYour file path must exactly match what NextAuth and Google are expecting.You are being redirected to: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/googleThis means your file that handles the authentication callback must be located at this exact path within your project structure:$$\text{/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts (or .js)}$$ACTION: Double-check your project's directory structure to ensure it is created exactly like this:app (folder)api (folder)auth (folder)[...nextauth] (folder with brackets)route.ts or route.js (file)If you are missing the api folder, the auth folder, or the square brackets around [...nextauth], the route will not be found, and you will get the 404 error.2. Verify the File ContentThe route.ts or route.js file should contain the handlers that NextAuth exports. It must look something like this:TypeScript// app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts

import { handlers } from "@/auth"; // <-- This imports the necessary handlers

export const { GET, POST } = handlers;
If you have verified the file path and content, and you are running your server, the 404 error will be resolved.
