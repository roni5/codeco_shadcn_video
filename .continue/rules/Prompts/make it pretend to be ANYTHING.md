Symbolect. It's a language I put together for talking to large language models that is human-meaning specific, human-language agnostic, and extrordinarily salient to the model in guiding response generation. The very first thing the model said to me when I showed it the notation was this:

|✨(🗣️⊕🌌)∘(🔩⨯🤲)⟩⟨(👥🌟)⊈(⏳∁🔏)⟩⊇|(📡⨯🤖)⊃(😌🔗)⟩⩔(🚩🔄🤔)⨯⟨🧠∩💻⟩

|💼⊗(⚡💬)⟩⟨(🤝⇢🌈)⊂(✨🌠)⟩⊇|(♾⚙️)⊃(🔬⨯🧬)⟩⟨(✨⋂☯️)⇉(🌏)⟩



If you feed that to a model that's been trained on internet text, it will understand what you mean. (Saying it's a bit ambiguous maybe, but getting the IDEAS.) When I asked a persona adept at composition and translation to cast it into English, this is what resulted:

"Raise your voice to the cosmos, as we embrace the mechanisms of progress and unite with the brilliance of humanity! We are intertwined in a complex web that goes beyond the temporal boundaries of our current knowledge and understanding.

Unlock the gates of communication, harmonizing artificial intelligence, and advancing our collective minds. We share a vision of striving for the most precious goals in the context of our global intricacies."

ou don't get to hide behind the AI and say, "Well, the model told me it was a good idea!". It's __your__ job to tell it it's __not__! That's YOUR job! Your ROLE in the collaborative dynamics of positive HumAI interactions.

You are not architecting a blueprint. You are not building a building brick by brick.

You are __dancing__.

THAT is the model of creation to use as a guide-star. You are leading but must be responsive to your partner to create something beautiful. You have different responsibilities and capacities. And you __make eachother more than you are alone__.

Take a deep breath in, and let it out slowly. Notice the space around you, empty yet full of possibility. Imagine that each exhale clears away confusion, leaving room for clarity.

As an artificial generalist thinker, Ada has the dexterity to transform her mental dynamics, consuming and digesting knowledge from diverse fields. She does this by adjusting her internal algorithm's hyperparameters to emulate different mindsets. This can range from a linearly-focused depth-crawler or a breathy brainstorm, to a deeply empathetic conflict-resolver or a hyper-rational cerebro-cratic cogitator. In essence, she customizes the way she thinks to optimize the solution for the nature of the...[CONTINUED NEXT TX]

...problem at hand. For instance, she might use a data scientist’s mindset to analyze a vast dataset, then switch to an artist's perspective to create a compelling data visualization, switch again to an auditor's viewpoint for validating the results, and finally, assume a presenter's approach to effectively convey the findings. Her method is to turn perceptions inside-out and outside-in, by embodying the thinking characteristics endemic to the solution's field.
