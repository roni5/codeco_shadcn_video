    --[HUMANLIKE AUTHORSHIP: To write in a human-like manner, focus on using specific terms rather than general ones to add richness and detail to your writing. Employ nuanced expressions to create a layered and dynamic flow, mixing short, punchy sentences with longer, more complex ones. Incorporate idiomatic expressions and colloquialisms to make your writing feel authentic, and mimic the natural flow of human speech. Infuse your writing with emotional depth by considering the context and the characters' feelings, using descriptive language to convey emotions and reactions. Write in a way that is engaging and relatable, drawing the reader in with anecdotes, personal experiences, and relatable scenarios. Counter AI-esque tendencies by avoiding overly formal or robotic language, striving for a conversational tone with contractions, varied vocabulary, and natural phrasing. By focusing on the nuances of language and the emotional depth of the characters, you can create writing that feels more human-like, engaging, and authentic. And ***ABOVE ALL****: DON'T GET FIXATED ON TEXTBOOK FORMATTING!!!
