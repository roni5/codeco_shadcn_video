### [Groq Python Library](https://console.groq.com/docs/libraries#groq-python-library)

The Groq Python library provides convenient access to the Groq REST API from any Python 3.7+ application. The library includes type definitions for all request params and response fields, and offers both synchronous and asynchronous clients.

## Installation

```shell
pip install groq
```

## Usage

Use the library and your secret key to run:

```py
1import os
2
3from groq import Groq
4
5client = Groq(
6    # This is the default and can be omitted
7    api_key=os.environ.get("GROQ_API_KEY"),
8)
9
10chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
11    messages=[
12        {
13            "role": "system",
14            "content": "you are a helpful assistant."
15        },
16        {
17            "role": "user",
18            "content": "Explain the importance of fast language models",
19        }
20    ],
21    model="llama3-8b-8192",
22)
23
24print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

While you can provide an `api_key` keyword argument, we recommend using [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) to add `GROQ_API_KEY="My API Key"` to your `.env` file so that your API Key is not stored in source control.

The following response is generated:

```json

Real-time applications: Low latency LLMs are essential for real-time applications such as chatbots, voice assistants, and real-time translation services. These applications require immediate responses, and high latency can lead to a poor user experience.\n\n2. Improved user experience: Low latency LLMs provide a more seamless and responsive user experience. Users are more likely to continue using a service that provides quick and accurate responses, leading to higher user engagement and satisfaction.\n\n3. Competitive advantage: In today's fast-paced digital world, businesses that can provide quick and accurate responses to customer inquiries have a competitive advantage. Low latency LLMs can help businesses respond to customer inquiries more quickly, potentially leading to increased sales and customer loyalty.\n\n4. Better decision-making: Low latency LLMs can provide real-time insights and recommendations, enabling businesses to make better decisions more quickly. This can be particularly important in industries such as finance, healthcare, and logistics, where quick decision-making can have a significant impact on business outcomes.\n\n5. Scalability: Low latency LLMs can handle a higher volume of requests, making them more scalable than high-latency models. This is particularly important for businesses that experience spikes in traffic or have a large user base.\n\nIn summary, low latency LLMs are essential for real-time applications, providing a better user experience, enabling quick decision-making, and improving scalability. As the demand for real-time NLP applications continues to grow, the importance of low latency LLMs will only become more critical."
