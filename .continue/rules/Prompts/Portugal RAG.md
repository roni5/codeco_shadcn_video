I want you to help Make a RAG in python , that will scrape Portuguese Real estate Agent websites , I am not concerned about , just scraping only one website at a time ... The goal is to have RAG that is Template for me to adjust , manually in code myself, and Change the Query Parameter , I will give you 2 HTML examples . I want you act both as Machine Learning data Scientist and a Property Lawyer , and Advisor , In Portugal, estate agents , Land issues are notorious for misleading , client , no due diligence on , "habitation Licence" rights and the pre 1951 rule, they try to pass off Agricultural support buildings as "habitable Property" , so I have couple of estate agents examples I want to , you help me to order the Data , Sub categories , for my RAG retrieval , I want you to analyse , the Html of these sites and Help define my RAG based on 1. has rooms amount :weight as good high value positive data ,2. more than 3 arches of Land :weight as good 3. Has water :weight as good 4. Has water storage or Tank 5. Land has "NOT" sitting right next to a Neighbour: :weight as good --- 6. Rural Agriculture build ::weight as bad , 7. Next to Road ::weight as bad 8. Any area in Fogo , Fire Zone ::weight as bad 9. Any area Restricted by Nature Reserve : ::weight as bad .They estate agent site have Tipo in English Type , but this tricky part , you can have Rural Ruins with "habitation Licence" but many site , do not wish you to dissemintate this for there own profit , Its not illegal what they do , But it is definitely immoral , not nice , wasting peoples hard earn money is Casthrophic : I want to try and Help to do my RAG Retrieval , I want to Group Data categories into Data set , Not a boolean , yes has habitation Licence or No , it more difficult than that , you have dissemenate as they will never say that in the web page, So the intention of this to weed out the ::weight as bad , I will be using llama3.2 and Possible LangChain , act the role of Machine Learning data Scientist , any and all recommendation , from you would be much appriecated
