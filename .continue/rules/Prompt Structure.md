To create a prompt for your usual stack (drizzle, PostgresQL, NextJS 15 with Shadi UI), here's a suggested approach:

  
**Prompt Structure: Crafting Effective Queries**

A well-structured prompt is crucial for getting accurate and relevant responses from an AI language model. Here are some key elements to consider when crafting your prompts:

**1. Clear and Concise Instructions:**

- **Directness:** State your request clearly and concisely.
- **Specificity:** The more specific your prompt, the better the response. For example, instead of "Tell me about dogs," you could ask, "What are the top 5 most popular dog breeds in the US?"
- **Action Verbs:** Use action verbs to guide the model's response, such as "write," "explain," "summarize," or "compare."

**2. Contextual Information:**

- **Background:** Provide relevant background information or context to help the model understand your query.
- **Constraints:** Specify any limitations or constraints, such as word count, format, or style.

**3. Desired Output Format:**

- **Structure:** Indicate the desired format, such as a list, paragraph, or table.
- **Style:** Specify the desired tone or style, such as formal, informal, humorous, or persuasive.

**Example Prompt:**

> **Prompt:** Write a concise summary of the French Revolution in 50 words or less, highlighting key events and their significance.

**Example of a Poorly Structured Prompt:**

> **Prompt:** Tell me about the French Revolution.

This prompt is too broad and lacks specific guidance. A better prompt would provide more context and a specific task, such as:

> **Improved Prompt:** Summarize the main causes and effects of the French Revolution in a few sentences.

By following these guidelines, you can significantly improve the quality and relevance of the responses generated by AI language models.

**Would you like to practice crafting effective prompts?**:**

Use a clear and concise structure to describe the task you want to accomplish. For example:

```

Implement a feature to integrate Drizzle with Shadi UI on NextJS 14, using PostgresQL as the database.

```

**Tips and Tricks:**

1. **Understand your tech stack**: Familiarize yourself with each technology component involved. This will help you tailor the prompt to their specific requirements.

2. **Focus on key features**: Identify essential features you want to implement or improve in your application.

3. **Specify database schema**: Provide a detailed outline of the data models and relationships relevant to your project.

4. **Include user experience considerations**: Think about how users will interact with the new feature and what kind of feedback you want to collect.

  

**Example Response:**

Here's an example prompt that incorporates these tips:

  

```

Implement a "Book Now" button that integrates Drizzle with Shadi UI on NextJS 14, using PostgresQL as the database. The button should:

- Validate user input for required fields (e.g., name, email, phone number)

- Send data to the server via an API request

- Display a confirmation message after successful submission

- Handle errors and display helpful feedback messages

  

Assumptions:

  

* Drizzle has already been set up as the state management system.

* Shadi UI is integrated with NextJS 14 using their official guidelines.

* PostgresQL database schema includes tables for users, appointments, and bookings.

  

Please provide a sample code snippet to demonstrate how this integration can be achieved."
